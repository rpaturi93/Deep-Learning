# Deep-Learning
Contains python codes corresponding to deep learning models
This repository consists of my academic work and projects related to Deep Learning.
Different deep learning models like DNN, CNN ,LSTM and fine tuning using VGG and their implementions are presented in these files 
These models are used for classifications, predictions and translations based on the dataset.
